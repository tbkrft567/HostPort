            skills in MS Excel, VBA, and SQL, I decided it was time to make an attempt at becoming a developer. To

            One of my strongest traits is leadership. In college, I was a Resident Assistant and was promoted to one of

      </div>
      <div class="subBanner"></div>
      <div class="contentBoundaries">
         <p class="paragraphContent">
            Graduating from UNT, with a finance degree, I found myself still searching for my true passion. I knew I
            had
            a knack for all things Excel, but what could this lead to? I began working for a mortgage
            company, Mr. Cooper. First as an intern then full-time as a Claims Associate. With the routine nature of
            this position and absolute dependency of Excel, it bred the opportunity for automating my own tasks. Here I
            taught myself, using VBA, to sync up with the company's management system to complete a large portion of
            my
            daily work. Quickly, I grew bored of this mundane work, next, SQL Server. I was introduced to a reporting
            team using this code I had never heard of. I made it my goal to learn it, but access to this software in
            Claims was not an option, so it was time to look elsewhere.
         </p>
         <p class="paragraphContent">
            I was able to secure a position with the newly-minted Account Services
            (AS)
            Reverse Mortgage team. This team's purpose was to receive and post customer payments.
            With the team being no older than six months, this was the perfect situation for someone with my talents
            and
            drive. Without knowing it, they were looking for someone that could provide quick solutions at a
            low-level
            while waiting years for IT buildouts and more permanent solutions. Through sheer self-initiative, I
            put
            my skills to work. Applying my Excel knowledge, sharpening my VBA skills, and familiarizing myself with
            SQL
            Server, I generated numerous processes to help save our team hours of manual works. Starting with my
            primary
            responsibility, I began building out a reconciliation process done daily using Excel/VBA evolving a
            cumbersome 8-hour report to a 3-4 hour, reliable, and consistency report. Picking up steam, I learned to
            link SQL to Excel, allowing me to create an interest calculator, payment processing tool, check form
            generator,
            among others. These enhancements instantly gave the power directly to our associates, so they could make
            better more informed decision at a quicker rate.
         </p>
         <p class="paragraphContent">
            This effort did not go unnoticed, with looming vacancy of their Business Analyst, I was offered a
            promotion.
            This role continued to oversee the AS Mortgage team, but now included an additional 12 teams and 65
            employees. With this move, I inherited the responsibility of monitoring, modifying, and maintaining the
            SharePoint site utilized as an enterprise workflow application. With no prior knowledge, I had just 3
            weeks
            of dedicated time with my predecessor before I was given the full reigns. This site was home to nearly a
            million requests completed per year. Though, this was a gross over usage of
            SharePoint and its intended use, it was, like most business operations, the temporary yet current
            solution. This SharePoint site was created using InfoPath for interactive forms and Nintex (and
            eventually
            SharePoint Designer) for workflow automation. The journey was certainly a rocky one but lent itself to
            being a tremendous learning experience.
         </p>
         <p class="paragraphContent">
            Quickly, I became a go-to in the department for SQL queries, Excel/VBA reporting, and most any other
            technical know-how. At one point, for 3 months, being the only available analyst. This, again, was a
            tremendous learning experience. I responded by being composed and in-control despite the
            never-ending
            stream of requests coming through. With a strong forged relationship with my manager and her supervisor, I
            was
            able to meet their expectations. I became responsible for all daily SQL report, daily technical
            troubleshooting, emergency SQL query generator, while maintaining SharePoint. With a level head, I
            approached
            each day with positive attitude knowing I was enjoying the challenge and knowing I was genuinely loving
            the
            people I was serving.
         </p>
         <p class="paragraphContent">
            Over time, I began to feel the time for me to move forward was approaching. I began learning my first
            compiled language C# and digging deeper into more elaborate queries with SQL. I searched the company internally for
            software developer or reporting analyst positions, and though there was
            interest, there were no open positions. Fearing complacency, I decided to walk away and dive into <a
               href="coding.html">Coding Dojo</a>, a coding bootcamp, and here I am ready for the next
            chapter in my
            journey.
